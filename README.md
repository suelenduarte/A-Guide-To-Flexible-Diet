<h1>A Guide To Flexible Diet</h1>

<p>I created this website as a guide to help people who want to take control of their diet and have a healthier life. This is a responsive static website built with HTML5 and CSS3 hosted with Github Pages.</p>

<h5>I divided this website into these sections:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>Macros</li>
  <li>Recipes</li>
  <li>FAQ</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
<ul>
