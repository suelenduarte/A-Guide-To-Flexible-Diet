          <h2>What is Flexible Diet</h2>
          <p>First at all, <span>flexible diet is more of a lifestyle than a diet.</span> What matters is how many
            calories you eat and the proportion of macronutrients in your diet.
            <p>What are the macronutrients and some Examples:</p>

          <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
          <p>Define what you want: lose fat, maintain weight or gain muscle</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If want to lose weight, you need to eat less than what you burn (cutting).</li>
            <li>If you want to gain muscle, you need to eat more than what you burn (bulking). </li>
            <li>If you want to maintain weight, eat the same amount of what you burn (maintenance).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I'd say that before you start to use Flexible Diet in your daily life, track for 2 weeks how many calories
            you are consuming. This way, if you want to lose weight, you will see after you calculate how much you
            burn if you are eating less than that or not.
          </p>

          <h2>Calculate How Many Calories Your Burn Every
            Day and Your Macronutrients</h2>

          <p>We all have heard and probably calculated our Body Mass Index (BMI). You calculate it by taking your weight
            in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. If you want to use English measurements, pounds should be
            divided by inches squared. This should then be multiplied by 703 to convert from lbs/inches square to
            kg/meters square</p>
          <p>The table below show BMI ranges for overweight and obesity.</p>
          <table>
            <caption>BMI of Adults Ages 20 and Older</caption>
            <tr>
              <th>BMI</th>
              <th>Classification</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>18.5 to 24.9</td>
              <td>Normal weight</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>25 to 29.9</td>
              <td>Overweight</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>30+</td>
              <td>Obesity (including extreme obesity)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>40+</td>
              <td>Extreme obesity</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>This is a good indicator to estimate if you are overweight or have obesity, but it doesn&#39;t tell you
            much.</p>
          <p>Since muscle weigh more than fat, sometimes you have a BMI of 25, which you would be considered overweight
            but you don&#39;t look overweight.</p>
          <p>You must be asking then&#58; Is there any better way to evaluate your overall health and set a goal&#63;
          </p>
          <p>Yes&#33; You can use <a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/">TDEE Website</a> to calculate
            your
            maintenance,
            cutting and bulking calories and choose your macronutrients proportion (moderate, lower or higher carb).
